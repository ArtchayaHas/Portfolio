# Data science portfolio 

**This portfolio has a collection of projects that demonstrate various skills, including data gathering, data preparation, machine learning, deep learning, and data visualization.**

### Project 1 Youtube API 
In this project, I used the YouTube API to collect data from the official Love Live! YouTube channel. Then, I performed data manipulation, converted the data into a dataframe, and saved it as a CSV file. Additionally, PowerBI was used to create clear visualizations from the data.

Application- 
We have gained insights into the types of content that catch the interest of our customers and drive customer engagement. With this information, we can produce more engaging content that enhances customer interaction. 

### Project 2 Spotify 
For this project, I used data from Kaggle to conduct exploratory data analysis, regression analysis to predict the popularity of songs, and clustered songs to create a recommendation system.

Application-
The outcomes of this project can be leveraged as a reference for song production and also used for recommending songs to users.

### Project 3 Lenght of hospital stay (LOS) of COVID19 patients    
In this project, I used data from Kaggle to classify the duration of hospital stays for COVID-19 patients. Additionally, Gridsearch was used to identify the best parameters for the model

Application-
Length of hospital stay is crucial information for hospital management as it impacts bed regulation, healthcare worker allocation, and medication distribution. Furthermore, it offers insights into the hospital's capacity. Hence, identifying which patients are likely to stay in the mid to long-term will aid in hospital management.

### Project 4 CNN binary image classification   
For this project, I used image data from Kaggle and applied CNN to classify the images into two categories: smile and non-smile.

Application-
The outcomes of this project can be implemented in computer vision and provide customers with satisfaction when visiting a shop without requiring a survey.

### Project 5 Tech layoff visualization   
I used the tech layoff data from Kaggle to create a Tableau dashboard for visualization.

This dashboard can tell the story of tech company layoffs since the onset of COVID-19 up to the present time (end of January 2023).

### Project 6  Exploring world happiness report     
I acquired the World Happiness Report data from Kaggle and used SQLite with Python to gain insights from the data.

### Extra image processing code 
This project was the first that got my interest in pursuing a career as a data scientist. I gained knowledge about how computers interpret image data and learned that data comes in various forms beyond tabular data. Additionally, while studying how to process images, I gained insight into how image processing serves as the first step for computer vision and further applications, which I found fascinating.
