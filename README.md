# Data science portfolio 

## This portfolio consists of projects which used various skills, including data gatering, data preparation, ML, deep learning, and data visualization.

### Project 1 Youtube API 
In this project, I collected data from official Love Live! youtube channel using API, manipulated some data, changed the data into dataframe, and saved into csv file.
Also, I used PowerBI to make simple visualization from the data I got.

Application- 
We learnt what kinds of content customers got an interest and attractive enough to make customers interacted with. So, we can use the information to produce more content that increase customers engaging. 

### Project 2 Spotify 
I used data from kaggle to perform EDA, regression to predict popularity ot the songs, and clustered songs together then used it for recommendation system.

Application-
The result can be used for song production reference and song reccomendation for users.

### Project 3 Lenght of hospital stay (LOS) of COVID19 patients    
I used data from kaggle to perform classification of duration of hospital stay. Also, in this project Gridsearch to find the best parameter for the model. 

Application-
Lenght of stay is an essential information for hospital because it affects the management of hospital such as bed regulation, healthcare worker adjustment, and medication allocation. Furthermore, it provides insight of capacity of the hospital. Therefore, knowing which patients are prone to stay in mid-long term will help with hospital management. 

### Project 4 CNN binary image classification   
The image data from kaggle was used. Then CNN was used to classify images into 2 groups; smile and non-smile.

Application-
This can be used in computer vision and provide satisfaction of custumers who visited at the shop without survey. 

### Project 5 Tech layoff visualization   
The tech layoff data from kaggle was used to produce Tableau dashboard for visualization.

This dashboard can be used for story telling of tech company employment from the start of COVID19 until now (end of January, 2023). 

### Project 6 EDA with SQL    
The world happiness report data was acquired from kaggle and used SQLite with python to get some insight from the data. 

### Extra image processing code 
It was the first project that make me really wanted to change my job to data scientist. I learnt that data has many forms other than tabular data and how computer read and interpret image data. Additionally, while I was studing how to process the image, I got an knowledge that image processing is the first step for computer vision and further application which is very fascinating.
