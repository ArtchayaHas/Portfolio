	This project used dataset from 
		> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022


	From visualization we learnt that more than 50% of layoff were from American companies
which is well known for many tech companies such as Google and Meta. 
	Although overall consumer industry laid off thier employees the most,
if we considered as individual company, Amazon which doing retail industry is
the company that laid off the most of employees (18,150 people).
	Undoubtfully, we found that after COVID19 pandemic in 2020, the layoff was 
started due to lockdown and the situation was getting better after the vaccine 
distribution around Q4 of 2020. 
	Unfortunately, the prolonged Rusia-Ukrain war from February, 2022 until now
accelerated energy crisis resulting in inflation and the demand of using technologies
after lockdown was decreased, therefore the cost cutting is neccessary for the
companies. And this layoff still seems to be uptrend from Q2 of 2022 until now.
