## Project 12 Web app Regression prediction

This project I tried to make an easy data-driven web app from practice health care cost regression that I've done before.

After the regression model was trained and tested, it was saved in pickle and used for web app.

The web app was created by using streamlit. 

This wep app let user to provide basic informations that used as features of the model for health care cost prediction.
